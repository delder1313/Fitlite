  This page is loaded with suggestions for those of us who are on the go. If we have a long commute
  or we don't have access to a stove; this page is for you. It's a simple menu that does away with
  a lot of the packaging because it focuses on farm-to-table philosophy. It makes use of Farmer's Markets,
  has tips on how to pickle, preserve, or otherwise condense your food choices into easy
to grab meals and snacks that don't gyp your body of nutrition.
  Helpful links on this page also go to Cooks.com, and other sites that do one thing
  help you put together meals that won't cause your body to be shortchanged.
  This page will be further divided into the food groups you are familiar with, and the link
  to the U S dept of Agriculture will show you the latest in combining food groups. and a bunch of other lorem
  ipsum nonsense.
